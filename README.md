# RoPi Remote Controlled Robot

*RoPi* is a software solution for controlling a Raspberry Pi based robot:

  - Python based backend and webserver
  - Web interface for remote controlling it from any browser
  - Support for using the Raspberry Pi Camera module

> The reason behind implementing RoPi was offering the end user
> an easy to use solution for controlling the Raspberry Pi robot.
> It was implemented with the Pi2Go robot in mind but can be easily extended to support any
> other Raspberry Pi robot.

## How To Use It

### Introduction

![alt text](https://github.com/ThumbGen/ropi/blob/master/RoPi_moving.jpg?raw=true "RoPi Remote in action")

All the user has to do in order to control the robot (after installing the software on the robot) is to type the robot's address in a web browser. By default the web interface is available on port 80.

Clicking the toggle button labeled "Off" will "turn on" the robot by establishing a duplex (socket.io) connection with the server.

Note: A demo video will be uploaded soon...

#### Screen Layout

The screen is split in 3 main areas:
  - the left gauge: it is a speedometer displaying the current speed (in percent) and indicates the "cruising control" speed with a red triangle
  - the right gauge: it combines a temperature indicator (10-90 degrees Celsius) with a "parking sensor" indicator.
  - between both gauges there is either an analog clock (when the camera is off) or the video stream of the PI's camera displayed; under the camera there are two "progressbar-like" indicators for the CPU load and memory load respectively

On the bottom right corner there are two buttons ( - and + ) used to decrease/increase the "cruising speed" of the robot.

#### Indicators

All available indicators are visible in the screenshot below:

| Indicator     | Description   |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| ![alt text](https://cdn.rawgit.com/thumbgen/ropi/master/server/remote/RoPiRemote/images/Engine.svg "Engine")      | Indicates a broken socket.io link with the server |
| ![alt text](https://cdn.rawgit.com/thumbgen/ropi/master/server/remote/RoPiRemote/images/Frontassist.svg "Frontassist")      | Indicates that the Front-assist feature is activated (less than 10cm to detected obstacle. The robot can be moved only to the left, right or backwards      |
| ![alt text](https://cdn.rawgit.com/thumbgen/ropi/master/server/remote/RoPiRemote/images/Headlights.svg "Headlights")      | Indicates that the car is moving forward and the front-lights are on      |
| ![alt text](https://cdn.rawgit.com/thumbgen/ropi/master/server/remote/RoPiRemote/images/Parkingbrake.svg "Parkingbrake")      | Indicates that the car is stopped (handbrake)      |
| ![alt text](https://cdn.rawgit.com/thumbgen/ropi/master/server/remote/RoPiRemote/images/Parkingsensors.svg "Parkingsensors")      | Indicates that the ultrasonic sensor is activated (front parking sensors)      |
| ![alt text](https://cdn.rawgit.com/thumbgen/ropi/master/server/remote/RoPiRemote/images/Seatbelt.svg "Seatbelt")      | Dummy seat belt indicator      |
| ![alt text](https://cdn.rawgit.com/thumbgen/ropi/master/server/remote/RoPiRemote/images/Temperature.svg "Temperature")      | Indicates that the Raspberry Pi's temperature is too high (overheating)      |
| ![alt text](https://cdn.rawgit.com/thumbgen/ropi/master/server/remote/RoPiRemote/images/Tempomat.svg "Tempomat")      | Indicates that the cruise control is activated and a certain speed is set      |
| ![alt text](https://cdn.rawgit.com/thumbgen/ropi/master/server/remote/RoPiRemote/images/Turnsignal.svg "Turnsignal")      | Indicates that the robot is moving either to the left or to the right      |

The Parking Control indicator informs about the distance to the next obstacle (in cm) and indicates visually the proximity to that object. It also displays information about the 2 sensors used for following a line.

Above the camera there is a working digital clock and a dummy outside temperature display.
Under the camera there are 2 progress bars indicating the current CPU and memory load.

#### Controlling the Robot and the Camera

The screen is split into two logical areas. The left area is for controlling the robot's movement and the right area is for controlling the pan & tilt of the camera (if installed and activated).

By tapping on the left area (or on mouse down) a green virtual joystick will appear (see image above) and the robot will start moving accordingly to the joystick movements. By removing the finger from the screen (or mouse up) the robot will stop moving.

By tapping on the right area (or on mouse down) a blue virtual joystick will appear and the camera will pan and tilt accordingly to the joystick movements. By removing the finger from the screen (or mouse up) the camera will center (if the "Follow me" mode is currently selected).

#### Settings Menu

![alt text](https://github.com/ThumbGen/ropi/blob/master/RoPi_settings.jpg?raw=true "Settings")

The Robot IP or Host entry is automatically populated with the address of the robot where the web interface is currently connected. This address is used for pushing robot data to the remote (socket.io) and for the camera stream. By modifying this address is possible to connect to the camera stream of a different robot (if needed).

 - The *Shutdown Robot* button will trigger a graceful shutdown of the Raspberry Pi's operating system. NOTE: You still need to manually switch off the robot itself.

 - The *Reboot Robot* button will trigger a restart of the Raspberry Pi's operating system.

 - The *Stop Server* button is usually used to stop the RoPi server running on the Raspberry (useful when debugging).

### Installation

#### Setup the Server
Under construction...
```sh
$ git clone [git-repo-url] ropi
$ cd ropi
$ ./app.py
```
#### Setup the Camera
