*RoPi* is a complete software solution for controlling a Raspberry Pi based robot:

  - Python based backend and webserver
  - Web interface for remote controlling it from any browser
  - Support for using the Raspberry Pi Camera module

> The reason behind implementing RoPi was offering the end user
> an easy to install and use solution for controlling the Raspberry Pi robot.
> It was implemented with the Pi2Go robot in mind but can be easily extended to support any
> other Raspberry Pi robot.
