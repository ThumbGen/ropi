# RoPi Remote Controlled Robot

*RoPi* is a software solution for controlling a Raspberry Pi based robot:

  - Python based backend and webserver
  - Web interface for remote controlling it from any browser
  - Support for using the Raspberry Pi Camera module

> The reason behind implementing RoPi was offering the end user
> an easy to use solution for controlling the Raspberry Pi robot.
> It was implemented with the Pi2Go robot in mind but can be easily extended to support any
> other Raspberry Pi robot.

## How To Use It

### Introduction

![alt text](https://github.com/ThumbGen/ropi/blob/master/RoPi_moving.jpg?raw=true "RoPi Remote in action")

All the user has to do in order to control the robot (after installing the software on the robot) is to type the robot's address in a web browser. By default the web interface is available on port 80.

Clicking the toggle button labeled "Off" will "turn on" the robot by establishing a duplex (socket.io) connection with the server.

#### Screen Layout

The screen is split in 3 main areas:
  - the left gauge: it is a speedometer displaying the current speed (in percent) and indicates the "cruising control" speed with a red triangle
  - the right gauge: it combines a temperature indicator (10-90 degrees Celsius) with a "parking sensor" indicator.
  - between both gauges there is either an analog clock (when the camera is off) or the video stream of the PI's camera displayed

On the bottom right corner there are two buttons ( - and + ) used to decrease/increase the "cruising speed" of the robot.

#### Indicators

#### Controlling the Robot and the Camera

### Installation

```sh
$ git clone [git-repo-url] ropi

```

* [jQuery] - duh
